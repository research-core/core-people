    subject: Scientific Software
    description: 'The goal of the Scientific Software and Development Platform
        is to provide high-quality software to support research at the individual, group
        and program levels to support the highest level science possible while controlling
        costs and reducing redundant effort. The platform will provide three classes
        of service: research, provisioning and support for existing software; custom
        development development by contract for individuals and groups; organization-wide
        software and research support technology. The Platform will provide a professional
        level of service, development and support with the aim of reducing redundant
        effort, increasing reusability of software solutions, controlling costs and
        improving the ability of investigators to focus on research questions. The Platform
        could both utilize PhD students in computer science and engineering as well
        as contract any extra development services capacity to external clients to reduce
        costs and integrate the CF with the larger scientific community.'
